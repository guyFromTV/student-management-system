# Data Structures and Algorithms Project

This project implements various data structures and algorithms in C, focusing on a singly linked list for managing student data. 

Features:
- Add student information (name, ID, grade)
- Search for students by ID
- Sort the list by grade
- Split and merge the list based on grades
- Calculate the exam average
- Manage the list by deleting the last student

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc main.c dsaproject.c -o student_manager`)
3. Run the program (`./student_manager`)
